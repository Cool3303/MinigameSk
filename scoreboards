#This requires the add-on skript+
#when a player executes the join command to join the minigame you will need to show the scoreboard to him.
#your code would look somthing like this
on command "/join" #command there or you could have it in the command its self instead of using the on command event
 display board named "(name)" to player #this here is what appears at the top of the scoreboard
 make score "(name)" in board of player to (number) #these here will be what you would like to display in the scoreboard and the number.
 move display of player to "sidebar" #this here is where you would like to display the scoreboard i would recommend using the sidebar
 
#to make a point/team system where a player kills another player on the opposite then it adds 1 to the attackers team scoreboard you would do somthing like this
on death of player:
 if {team.%player%} is green
  loop all players: # you need to loop all the players because the scoreboards are client side
   add 1 to {red.kills}
   make score "red:" in board of loop-player to {red.kills}
 if {team.%player%} is red
  loop all players:
   add 1 to {green.kills}
   make score "green:" in board of loop-player to {green.kills}
#then if you wanted to make the game end once a team reaches a limit and annouce who wins you would do somthing like this
on death of player:
 wait 1 tick #you dont have to do this but i would recommend having it here
 if {red.kills} is (limit):
  loop all players:
   if {team.%loop-player%} is green or red:
    message "&3[&4Minigame&3] Team red have won!" to loop-player
    make loop-player execute command "/spawn"
 if {green.kills} is (limit):
  loop all players:
   if {team.%loop-player%} is green or red:
    message "&3[&4Minigame&3] Team green have won!" to loop-player
    make loop-player execute command "/spawn"
 #this is only some scoreboard stuff and not a fully working skript i will add some more stuff to this later on
